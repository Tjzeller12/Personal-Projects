Hello! This program is a stock compare tool. When the user runs the program a Frame becomes visible. On this frame there are four buttons to chose
from. The first button is "Industry Compare." When clicked, a new Frame is opened. This Frame allows the user to select an industry and compare every
stock in that industry. The list of stocks are sorted by rating from highest to lowest. The second button is "Stock Compare." When clicked, a new 
frame opens that allows the user to enter 5 stocks that they wish to compare. The third button is "Add Stock." Once a again a new frame will open.
This frame is full of text fields so the user can enter statistics and add a stock to the the "ListOfStocks.txt" text file. This frame also contains
a table that includes every stock. The user can type new information into the table's cells and save the new information. The text file acts as a data
base that contains all the stocks that can be accessed in this program. If there are no stocks in this text file the user will not be able to compare
any stocks. Finally, the fourth button is simply an exit button. When clicked the program closes.

This program was created to help me practice and get back into programming. It was also made to help me compare stocks based on values that I think
are important to consider when purchasing a stock. I am going to code every day for the rest of my enlistment in the USMC (a little over a year).
This program will be the start of that journey and I am very excited to see what I learn and how my code looks at the end this year :).
